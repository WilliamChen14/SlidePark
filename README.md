# ForestOfTrials
Our project is inspired by the recently released Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, a 3D game where you look from an angled birdseye view. This keeps your hands free from needing to move the camera but still provides a 3D environment to play on. Having a 3D environment will allow us to implement many of the techniques we learned for graphics during class and try new things. Our main idea for the game is a game where there is a main character you can control with “wasd” controls and “space” for jump. This allows you to explore the environment or levels provided freely.  We hope to include a story, puzzles, enemies/combat, and unique items to the environment to interact with.
